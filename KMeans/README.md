# K-Means

> K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science.

### What is it and How it works?

Unsupervised Machine Learning is the process of teaching a computer to use unlabeled, unclassified data and enabling the algorithm to operate on that data without supervision. Without any previous data training, the machineâ€™s job in this case is to organize unsorted data according to parallels, patterns, and variations. 

K means clustering, assigns data points to one of the K clusters depending on their distance from the center of the clusters. It starts by randomly assigning the clusters centroid in the space. Then each data point assign to one of the cluster based on its distance from centroid of the cluster. After assigning each point to one of the cluster, new cluster centroids are assigned. This process runs iteratively until it finds good cluster. In the analysis we assume that number of cluster is given in advanced and we have to put points in one of the group.

In some cases, K is not clearly defined, and we have to think about the optimal number of K. K Means clustering performs best data is well separated. When data points overlapped this clustering is not suitable. K Means is faster as compare to other clustering technique. It provides strong coupling between the data points. K Means cluster do not provide clear information regarding the quality of clusters. Different initial assignment of cluster centroid may lead to different clusters. Also, K Means algorithm is sensitive to noise. It maymhave stuck in local minima.
