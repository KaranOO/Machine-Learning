## Machine Learning: What is it?

> **IMPORTANT**  
> Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables algorithms to uncover hidden patterns within datasets, allowing them to make predictions on new, similar data without explicit programming for each task. Traditional machine learning combines data with statistical tools to predict outputs, yielding actionable insights. This technology finds applications in diverse fields such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, and automating tasks.

> **NOTE**  
> For instance, recommender systems use historical data to personalize suggestions. Netflix, for example, employs collaborative and content-based filtering to recommend movies and TV shows based on user viewing history, ratings, and genre preferences. Reinforcement learning further enhances these systems by enabling agents to make decisions based on environmental feedback, continually refining recommendations.

## Life Cycle of ML / Steps

![Life Cycle](readmeImage/lifeCycle.png)

The life cycle of a machine learning project typically includes the following steps:

1. **Problem Definition**: Identify and clearly define the problem you aim to solve.
2. **Data Collection**: Gather data relevant to the problem from various sources.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to discover patterns, correlations, and insights.
5. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem.
6. **Model Training**: Train the model on the prepared dataset.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
8. **Model Tuning**: Fine-tune the model to improve its performance.
9. **Deployment**: Deploy the model in a production environment.
10. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor and maintain the model to ensure it performs well over time.
